Starting with a number of labelsudio rectangle labeled (RL) projects:

1) Export the RL projects to json, run rect2poly on them and import them into polygon labelled(PL) projects
2) Export the PL projects as COCO
2a) If its one large project to train on, use traintestsplit to categorize.
2b) If its multiple projects, use traintestsplit and TODO find a way to merge two coco exports.
