# TODO implement kb vanilla with 3 channels
# TODO implement kb ndim with 3 + n channels
# TODO make a script for downloading and verifying text corresponding to image. Support different methods of vectorization
# TODO design architecture so experiments can be run using 
# a) vanilla or ndim(n=x), 
# b) different datasets, 
# c) output logs and corresponding visualizations to a directory (modify model.py to return history then https://valueml.com/how-to-visualize-the-training-process-in-keras/)
# based on config (a, b, c)
